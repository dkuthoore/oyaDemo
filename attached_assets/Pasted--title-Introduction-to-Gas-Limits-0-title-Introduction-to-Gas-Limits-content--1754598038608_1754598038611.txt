"Gas limits refer to the maximum amount of gas that can be present in a given space or system without causing harm or damage. In chemistry, gas limits are critical in determining the safe handling and storage of gases. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets permissible exposure limits (PELs) for various gases to protect workers from hazardous environments (OSHA, 2022). In cryptocurrency, gas limits refer to the maximum amount of computational effort required to execute a transaction or smart contract on a blockchain network."

"Gas limits are essential in ensuring safety, efficiency, and security in various applications. In industrial processes, gas limits help prevent accidents and injuries caused by gas leaks or explosions. In cryptocurrency, gas limits prevent network congestion and ensure that transactions are processed efficiently. According to a study published in the Journal of Cryptography, gas limits play a critical role in maintaining the security and scalability of blockchain networks (Journal of Cryptography, 2020)."

body
: 
"There are several types of gas limits, including lower flammable limits (LFLs), upper flammable limits (UFLs), and permissible exposure limits (PELs). LFLs and UFLs are critical in determining the safe handling and storage of flammable gases. PELs, on the other hand, are set by regulatory agencies to protect workers from hazardous environments. In cryptocurrency, gas limits are typically measured in units of gas, which represent the computational effort required to execute a transaction or smart contract."

body
: 
"Calculating gas limits involves determining the maximum amount of gas that can be present in a given space or system without causing harm or damage. In chemistry, gas limits are calculated using various formulas and equations, such as the ideal gas law and the flammability limits equation. In cryptocurrency, gas limits are calculated based on the computational effort required to execute a transaction or smart contract, which is typically measured in units of gas. According to a study published in the Journal of Computational Science, calculating gas limits is critical in ensuring the security and scalability of blockchain networks (Journal of Computational Science, 2022)."
